# HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod (Server Friendly)

**Feral Development Team** presents a "Server Friendly" version of **HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod**.
Tired of having to run your server with a mod which has 70%+ items banned and unusable? Our customised version of HBM's NTM has many different changes which should hopefully help you with this!

As expected, we may be a few versions behind the main version; the reason for this is that we are not actively working on this and its main purpose was to only exist for the **FeralPvP: Modded War** server, however we decided to publish it and make it open source for everyone to use to their liking.

This project is still in the very **early BETA stages**, we will not take responsibility if this causes any server crashes, corruption, etc. Please use at your own risk.
If any problems are found, our team would be more than willing to find fixes for them and support you when needed. If you have any suggestions, please either contact us directly on Discord or via Github.
